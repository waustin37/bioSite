    <div class="bio">
<p>	
    Sean Carmon started dancing when he was 12 years old and has not stopped since. Starting in Beaumont, Texas, Sean has worked tirelessly
     to train in various styles of dance making him an incredibly versatile performer. He received the prestigious Gates Scholarship to 
     attend any college in the country tuition free, and Sean chose to go to NYU. There he saw The Alvin Ailey American Dance Company for 
     the first time and he know he had to be a part of that historic company. He immediately switched college, and opted to attend the  
     training program at Ailey
     at Fordham University. There he trained with some of the greatest in the world, and proved to himself and his classmates that he was not
     just the best dancer in a small town, he was a world class dancer, period. <br />
     While in his final year at Fordham, Sean received a phone call 
     from a casting director looking for an emergency replacement for one of the dancers in the Broadway revival of Les Cage Aux Folles. 
     Sean rushed down to the audition and danced his heart out, booking him the job. He performed for the entire run of that show, while 
     finishing school. When Les Cage closed he auditioned and was cast in The Phantom of the Opera. He only worked a month though, before 
     The Ailey Company hired him as one of their company dancers. He danced with Ailey for seven years, touring the world. He then heard the 
     siren call of Broadway once more and got booked for The Lion King. He has worked and worked and worked. His career is enviable to 
     almost anyone in the arts.
